- BackStory / History / EXP.
-
-  I'm Not a Data Scientist, not a Neurologist, not a Fullstack Senior Dev. , I'm not any of those. I'm just fascinated With AI .
- I built my first PC in 1987 I've allways built my PC's. My first "computer" was a Commodaore Vic20 that I got when I was 11yo.
- I Taught myself BASiC on that with just the manual that came with it. Few people knew what "The Internet" was back then, Hell they
- were just getting Cable service then.
- And I Am Litterally an AMD Liffer!! I've never used any other Processor in any of my Rigs.Which is another Reason this needs more AMD eyes on it .
- Through the 80's to 2000 I watched the internet Form before my very eyes. I was on Prodigy , had used CompuServe, Used Mosaic before the WWW was known
- I still use my original AOL Email account to this Very day .
- I Learnd HTML , built websites did all the things . BUT I was naive, I had No Idea what would come
- and even fewer people believed in what I Saw. And I missed The boat !!
- I had to feed my child , and raise a family and at that time there
- just wasn't enough momentum or interest for me to move down that path (which I've Regreted every day since). Everyone thought it was a "FAD".
-
-  Here We Are 40 some odd years later! after a life of hard work in Home Renovation and Remodleing. I'm too old and Tired to keep that up .
- I've always kept up with what was going on in the virtual world , there hasn't been a day I wasn't "Connected" But I'm Here to Pick up where I Left off
- all those years ago. It's going to be hard and i'll struggle , but these are the tool that will help me. and I'm sure I may find At Least a few people
- that will have some faith in me and my Vision. I'm unortodox , my Grammar is shit!, can't spell half the time . and i'm becoming a Grumpy old man. (lol)
- But I know ONE Thing !!
-  I am NOT missing This BOAT a Second Time !!
